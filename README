On one of my projects I have the need to communicate with the API provided by
CPanel and WHM:
http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/AutomationIntegration/XmlApi

I found an existing module for this on CPAN:
http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?API::CPanel

The problem with this module is that it uses XML to communicate with CPanel and
I rather use the JSON API, for this reason I created my own interpretation of the
module but using JSON.

The module is highly incomplete right now, and altough I'm using it in production
mode at the moment without a problem, I can't be sure that will be true for
everyone.

Perhaps the first problem I have is the name of the module, at the moment of
creation it didn't occur to me to name it in another way but surely I will rename
it when it's ready for CPAN.
